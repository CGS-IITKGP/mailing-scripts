We are afraid to be writing with some bad news. Unfortunately, we would not be able to extend your selection application to Kharagpur Open Source Society.<br><br>

The selections this year have by far been the toughest we have experienced, even after stretching the interview and judging process for many days.<br><br>

Your caliber was outstanding to the point that we found ourselves, unfortunately, having to turn down even the most highly qualified applicants with fantastic submissions. We tried our best to increase the amount of intake this year, but we don't have the bandwidth to be able to take on more of you and still ensure you all have a great experience.<br><br>

Even if you’re not a part of KOSS, we still hope to work together to spread Open Source awareness in Kharagpur because it takes a whole village to do that. We’re rooting for you and looking forward to seeing what you do next.<br><br>
